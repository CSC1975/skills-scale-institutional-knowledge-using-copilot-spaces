# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's central hub for project management processes and best practices. This documentation suite provides a complete framework for delivering customer-focused projects using iterative, transparent, and collaborative approaches.

OctoAcme follows a structured project lifecycle from initiation through retrospective, with clearly defined roles and ownership at each stage. Our approach emphasizes customer-first principles, iterative delivery of testable increments, and data-informed decision-making. Each project is led by a designated Project Manager who coordinates delivery and a Product Manager who defines outcomes and prioritizes work. Developers and QA teams collaborate closely throughout, supported by stakeholders who provide input and approvals at key decision points.

Communication and risk management are woven throughout the process, with regular standups, weekly syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates forming the backbone of project coordination. Teams use a standardized risk register to track and mitigate issues, and maintain clear escalation paths when blockers arise. Quality is built in through comprehensive testing practices including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, complemented by security scanning and manual QA where needed. Releases follow a structured deployment process with pre-release checks, smoke testing, and documented rollback plans to ensure reliability.

Continuous improvement is embedded in OctoAcme's culture through regular retrospectives that convert learnings into actionable items. Each project phase produces specific artifacts—from project one-pagers and roadmaps to sprint backlogs and retrospective notes—creating a transparent record of decisions and progress. This documentation provides templates, checklists, and guidance for each stage, enabling teams to deliver consistently while adapting to specific project needs.
